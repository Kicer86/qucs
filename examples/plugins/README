== Example plugins

Qucs must be installed so these examples work. See ../../INSTALL for details.
Then

$ make    # <-- for now.
[..]
$ ls *.so
hello_world.so
red_wire.so

Try

$ qucs -a ./hello_world |& grep hello
hello world

$ qucs -a ./red_wires -i ../schematics/bandpass.sch

== Your own plugin

Create your_plugin.cc in a new direcory. Copy MakeList and adjust it
accordingly. For now, also copy the Makefile. Build with make and use as shown
above.
