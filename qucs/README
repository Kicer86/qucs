Description
===========

Qucs was a circuit simulator with a graphical user interface. "Qucs, the GUI",
this package, was the graphical user interface for circuit simulation. The
software aimed to support various kinds of circuit simulation, e.g. DC, AC,
S-parameter and harmonic balance analysis.

The current work aims at enhancing the extensibility and maintainability of
"Qucs the GUI" and its user contributions. It consists of a library
implementing circuit related data structures and and a GUI for interactive
schematic editing and simulation. User data, such as circuit components,
specific schematic/netlist languages, visualisation tools as well as
simulator drivers can be loaded at runtime.

Requirements
============

Qucs needs Qt version 5 or later. For simplicity, the Qt configuration is
currently obtained through pkg-config, which you need to install in addition
to Qt.

On Debian, install

 pkg-config
 build-essential
 qtscript5-dev
 libqt5svg5-dev

For development purposes (i.e. in order to bootstrap) autotools are required.

Installation
============

Unpack the distribution tarball:

    $ tar xvzf qucs-<version>.tar.gz               (using GNU tar)
    $ gzip -cd qucs-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -   (using another tar)

Change into the source directory:

    $ cd qucs-<version>

Configure and build binaries for your system.

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make

Install Qucs (optional).

    $ make install

You need write permissions to the prefix of the installation (default:
/usr/local). See INSTALL for further details.

Please note:  Users of the FreeBSD OS may use a GNU make (probably gmake)
to compile and install the package.

use CMake instead
=================

(this needs work)

$ cd cmake
$ cmake .

or

$ mkdir cb
$ cd cb
$ cmake ../cmake

Getting the latest Git snapshot
===============================

You can get the latest Qucs version from our Git repository. Please use an
official release if you want to work with Qucs. The Git version might not
always compile or run smoothly. Currently, the main git repository is hosted
on github.

Debugging
=========

It is not normally recommended to install during development. Running the
programs directly from the build directory is possible, with some caveats.
Debugging is easiest with libtool, but the environment variables that are not
handled by autotools need to be set first.

$ cd $build_directory
$ . main/qucs       # set environment variables for running from builddir
$ libtool --mode=execute gdb --args main/qucs.real -i examples/bandpass.sch
