These are qucs plugins -- stuff that is optional and does not hard depend on
other plugins.

Each plugin is compiled from the files contained in a single directory and
listed in the MakeList file. The plugin name corresponds to the directory
name, and will be installed to ${pkglibdir}.

For example, a plugin that relates to my_stuff, will be compiled from files in
plugins/my_stuff/ and its name will be my_stuff.so. it will be installed such
that qucs will be able to load "my_stuff", e.g. by invoking qucs with the -a
my_stuff option.

TODO: more on how MakeList is meant to be used.
